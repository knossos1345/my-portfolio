## Experience

### Front-End Web Developer
##### *StunnerYPP Corporation | 03/2022 - Present*

I led the development of error handlers for Next.js applications, reducing uncaught errors by 90%, and converted a website from React.js to Next.js, improving page load times by 20%. My work involved developing and maintaining multiple client websites using React.js, Next.js, and Vanilla JS plugins, implementing JSON-LD structured data for enhanced SEO performance, and utilizing Redis for efficient data caching. I also integrated Next-Auth for seamless user authentication and created a custom Next.js site template, cutting development time by 30%.

In addition, I designed and implemented the majority of UI components for the company's monorepo NPM packages, used PM2 to enhance application performance and reliability, developed a site for VR streaming to enable immersive user experiences, and redesigned a website to increase visual appeal and user-friendliness, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement. My efforts in optimizing websites for search engines also improved organic search rankings and click-through rates.
